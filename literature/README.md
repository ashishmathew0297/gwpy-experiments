### Literature review

- Gengli is the package that we developed. You can find [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2051877) the main paper, [here](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2085379) the companion paper and [here](https://melissa.lopez.docs.ligo.org/gengli/index.html) the docs. Some folks use images instead of time series but we can discuss this at a later point.

- cDVGAN is Tom's work. [Here]() is the last version of his work

- I added in this folder the chapter 2 of my thesis that gives some context to detector stuff.
